    I am a dual major in Magazine, News, and Digital Journalism and Innovation, Society, and Technology. Iâ€™m interested in working with news media and analyzing data for media companies. 

    List of skills:
    Graphic design,
    Good communicator,
    Proficient in Google and Microsoft suites,
    Digital marketing, and
    Digital advertising. 

    Outside of work I enjoy discovering and listening to music, running, and cooking. My favorite movie currently is Interstellar and my favorite book is the Perks of Being a Wallflower.
